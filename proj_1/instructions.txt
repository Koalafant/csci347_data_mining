Part 1: Write an introduction.
In a well-written paragraph, answer the following questions about the data:
• [4 points] What was the data used for?
• [2 points] Who (or what organization) uploaded the data?
• [5 points] How many attributes and how many entities are represented in the data?
• How many numerical attributes?
• How many categorical attributes?
* Would you suggest that each categorical attribute be label-encoded or one-hot-
encoded? Why?
• [4 points] Are there missing values in the data? If so, what proportion of the data is missing
overall? What proportion of data is missing per attribute (you may use a plot or table to
summarize this information)?
• [7 points] Why is this data set interesting to you?
• [6 points] Of the attributes used to describe this data, which do you think are the most
descriptive of the data and why (before doing any data analysis) ?



Part 2: Write Python code for data analysis.
Use Python to write the following functions, without using any functions with the same purpose
in sklearn, pandas, numpy, or any other library (though you may want to use these libraries to
check your answers):
• [5 points] A function that will compute the mean of a numerical, multidimensional data set
input as a 2-dimensional numpy array
• [5 points] A function that will compute the sample covariance between two attributes that are
input as one-dimensional numpy vectors
• [5 points] A function that will compute the correlation between two attributes that are input as
two numpy vectors.
• [5 points] A function that will normalize the attributes in a two-dimensional numpy array using
range normalization.
• [5 points] A function that will normalize the attributes in a two-dimensional numpy array using
standard normalization.
• [5 points] A function that will compute the covariance matrix of a data set.
• [5 points] A function that will label-encode a two-dimensional categorical data array that is
passed in as input.




Part 3: Analyze the data with your code and write up the results.
Use your code from Part 2 to answer the following questions in a well-written paragraph, and
create the following plots from the numerical portion of the data:
Use your functions to compute the multi-variate mean and covariance matrix of the numerical
portion of your data set.
• Before answering the questions:
• [5 points] Convert all categorical attributes using label encoding or one-hot-encoding
• [2 points] If your data has missing values, fill in those values with the attribute mean.




Questions to answer:
• [2 points] What is the multivariate mean of the numerical data matrix (where categorical data
have been converted to numerical values)?
• [4 points] What is the covariance matrix of the numerical data matrix (where categorical data
have been converted to numerical values)?
• [5 points] Choose 5 pairs of attributes that you think could be related. Create scatter plots of
all 5 pairs and include these in your report, along with a description and analysis that
summarizes why these pairs of attributes might be related, and how the scatter plots do or
do not support this intuition.
• [3 points] Which range-normalized numerical attributes have the greatest sample covariance?
What is their sample covariance? Create a scatter plot of these range-normalized attributes.
• [3 points] Which Z-score-normalized numerical attributes have the greatest correlation? What
is their correlation? Create a scatter plot of these Z-score-normalized attributes.
• [3 points] Which Z-score-normalized numerical attributes have the smallest correlation? What
is their correlation? Create a scatter plot of these Z-score-normalized attributes.
• [3 points] How many pairs of features have correlation greater than or equal to 0.5?
• [3 points] How many pairs of features have negative sample covariance?
• [2 points] What is the total variance of the data?
• [2 points] What is the total variance of the data, restricted to the five features that have the
greatest sample variance?
